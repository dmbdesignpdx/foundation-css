## Foundation CSS

#### v1.0.0

An opinionated collection of base rulesets for your critical and/or global CSS. Browsers have come a long way over the past several years, some browsers have lost support, it's time to have your foundation rules reflect this evolution.

Includes:

- Resets
- Normalizations
- Basic grid
- Breakpoints
- And more

These are the basic rulesets that I've found helpful in my projects. They are a result of research, testing, and usage over the years, and now I'd like to share them.
